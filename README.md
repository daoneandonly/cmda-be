First of all,clone this project by running this in your terminal

```

Then move into the project

### Running the Node script

# Database structure

The database currently supports a single structure for a user. A `user` entity in the following structure:

```JSON
{
  "_id": "abc", // id generated by mongodb
  "name": "Darth Vader", // name of user
  "job": "Sith Lord", // current job of user
  "quote": "I find your lack of faith disturbing." // A personal quote of the user
}
```

The data used for the profiles page is served as `people` containing an array with all the users objects.
